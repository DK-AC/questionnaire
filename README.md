Project Overview:

The project is a web application designed for conducting surveys. In the application, users answer a series of questions by selecting one of the provided answer options. Upon completing the survey, the results are displayed, including the correct answers. After finishing the survey, users are offered the opportunity to play an engaging scratch game. Utilizing the Pixi.js, the web application creates a visual component consisting of two layers. To achieve victory, users must erase 80% of the first layer.

Technologies Used:

React: for building the user interface and managing application state.
Redux: for efficient state management.
React Router: for navigation between pages.
Pixi.js: for creating the visual component of the scratch game.
MUI (Material-UI): for creating the structure and styling the interface.
